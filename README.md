# Mover

This is a radio app for https://github.com/andrewn/neue-radio

The idea is that the beat detction will trigger servos to move for a moving radio.

Currently it just makes a blob move onscreen in time. Sort of.
 
It's based on this: https://github.com/JMPerez/beats-audio-api/blob/gh-pages/script.js
